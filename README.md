# super-palm-tree-library

Current Problems:

* File names containing special characters throwing errors (seems to be when extra '.'s are in the file name, also &'s' )
* Multiple files causes error, seems like a limit of 2 files

* this error, happens if I try and upload another file after the first group, have to reset server to upload more

Error: ENOENT, open 'uploads/ADORNO-cultural_criticism_and_society.pdf'
    at Error (native)

* Need to re-add OCR check ...
